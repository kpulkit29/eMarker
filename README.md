# eBookmarker ðŸ”– ðŸ”–

Let's you mark important stuff while you read. Isn't it frustrating to look for important topics (or maybe a topic where you left off) when you go through a document again after some time? Now no more searching/scrolling throughout the document, just use eBookmarker and it will land you there. Not only is it helpful in keeping track of important stuff you read, but also where you left off.

## Where to find it

Wait... How to use eBookmarker?

- Highlight the line or heading you would like to use as a bookmark.
- Open eBookmarker chrome extension to add this bookmark.
- The bookmark will be added for the current URL. Remember, multiple bookmarks can be added for a particular URL.

So next time whenever you open eBookmarker on that URL, all your bookmarks would be visible.

*Note:* eBookmarker remembers bookmarks by the URL they were created on.

Well, it might look complete but it still requires some work.
Features to work on -:
 - Delete Bookmarks
 - A list of all bookmarks with a navigate to URL functionality
 - Better UI (maybe)
